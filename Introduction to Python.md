# Introduction to Python

- Python is a general purpose programming language.
- It is a high level prog. lang.
- Developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989 at National Research Institue in Netherlands.
- It was officially made public on 20-02-1991

In python, We do not need to specify the datatypes to a variable. Based on passed value, python assigns the datatype.

## Example :
```	
>>> int_type=10
>>> float_type=20.5
>>> complex_type=10+2j
>>> bool_type=True
>>> text_type='Python'
>>> list_type=[1,2,3,4]
>>> tuple_type=(1,2,3,4)
>>> dictionary_type={'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}

>>> type(int_type)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(float_type)
<class 'float'>
>>> type(complex_type)
<class 'complex'>
>>> type(bool_type)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(text_type)
<class 'str'>
>>> type(list_type)
<class 'list'>
>>> type(tuple_type)
<class 'tuple'>
>>> type(dictionary_type)
<class 'dict'>
>>> 
```	

whenever you assign different value to the variable, python automatically changes the datatype.
## Example :
```	
>>> int_type='Python'
>>> type(int_type)
<class 'str'>
```
This is the reason that python is also called as dynamically typed programming language.

The name 'Python' derived from a TV show \'Monty Python's Flying Circus\'.

Python was developed by using following functionalities from different languages.

1. Functional programming from c
2. Oop concepts from c++
3. Scripting language features from Perl and shell script.
4. Modular programming features from Modula-3
5. Syntaxes borrowed from C and ABC language.

We can use python in so many areas as follows.
1. Desktop Applications
2. Web applications (Django)
3. Database applications
4. Networking
5. Games.
6. Data science
7. Machine learning
8. Artificial Intelligence.
9. Internet of things
	
Companies like google, microsoft, youtube, dropbox, NASA uses python.
