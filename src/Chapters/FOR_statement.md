# for loop in Python

We can use for loop if we know the exact number of the iterations to be performed.

### Syntax :
```
for <each-element> in sequence  :
    do-some-action
```
### Example :
```python
>>> for i in range(5) :
	    print(i*2)

	
0
2
4
6
8
>>> 
```

### Note : for loop is equivalent to for-each loop in java. It iterates every element.
