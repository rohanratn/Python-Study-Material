Introduction to Python

- Python is a general purpose programming language.
- It is a high level prog. lang.
- Developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989 at National Research Institue in Netherlands.
- It was officially made public on 20-02-1991


- In python, We do non need to specify the datatypes to a variable.
	based on passed value, python assigns the datatype.
	
	example :   
				>>>  a=10
				>>>  type(a)
				<class 'int'>
				
- whenever you assign different value to the variable,
	python automatically changes the datatype.
	
	example :  
				>>> a=True
				>>> type(a)
				<class 'bool'>

This is the reason that python is also called as dynamically typed programming language.

- The name 'Python' derived from a TV show 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'

Python was developed by using following functionalities from different languages.
	
	1. Functional programming from c
	2. Oop concepts from c++
	3. Scripting language features from Perl and shell script.
	4. Modular programming features from Modula-3
	5. Syntaxes borrowed from C and ABC language.
	

- We can use python in so many areas as follows.

	1. Desktop Applications
	2. Web applications (Django)
	3. Database applications
	4. Networking
	5. Games.
	6. Data science
	7. Machine learning
	8. Artificial Intelligence.
	9. Internet of things
	
- Copmanies like google, microsoft, youtube, dropbox, NASA uses python.


- Features of Python
	1. Simple and easy to learning.
	2. free and open source software.
	3. high level programming language.
	4. platform independendt code.
	5. portability.
	6. Dynamically typed language.
	7. Object oriented language.
	8. Interpreted language.
	9. Extensible language.
	10. Embedded language.
	11. Rich library support.
	
- Limitations of python 
	1. Performance 
	2. Not able to create Mobile applications
	
- Myths about python 
	It is not suitable for large scale enterprise applications.

- Flavours of python
	1. CPython ( c Python )
	2. Jython  ( for java)
	3. IronPython ( for c#)
	4. PyPy ( good performance than python)
	5. Ruby python ( for ruby)
	6. Anaconda Python ( big data apps )
	7. Stackless ( concurrency and multithreading)

- Versions of python 
	Python 1.0	jan 1994
	Python 2.0	Oct 2000
	Python 3.0	Dec 2008
	Python 3.6	2016
	
- Note : Python doesnt support backward compatibility
		i.e, Python 2.7 programs won't run in python 3.6
